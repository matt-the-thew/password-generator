- **DOM Manipulation**: Practice selecting and updating HTML elements using vanilla JavaScript
- **Event Handling**: Learn to work with click events on buttons and input events on range sliders
- **Random Number Generation**: Understand how `Math.random()` and array indexing work together to create randomness
- **ES6 Modules**: See how to export/import classes between separate JavaScript files
- **State Management**: Track and update the desired password length as user input changes
- **Algorithm Design**: Implement a simple algorithm that iterates to build strings character by character
